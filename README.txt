Located within the includes directory there is a file called Settings.php.

Ensure these settings, as well as the Database  settings ( db.php ) match your current configuration

Regarding FFMPEG - Ensure you have a version which suits your needs. I have included a Windows binary, and a Linux binary Downloaded from:

Windows  : http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
GNU/Linux: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-builds/?source=dlp

Place these binary files in: /administration/clip/ and make appropriate edits to convert.php.
